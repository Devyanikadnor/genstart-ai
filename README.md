# 🚀 GenStart AI

### *Think it. Type it. Build it.*

GenStart AI is a **multi-agent Generative AI platform** that converts a raw startup idea into a **complete, structured startup plan** in minutes.
It acts as a **virtual startup team** powered by **Google Vertex AI (Gemini)**.

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission

**Event:** Gen AI-thon (ML Nashik)
**Category:** Generative AI · Multi-Agent Systems · Google Cloud / Vertex AI
**Team:** GenStart AI

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most student and early-stage startup ideas fail not because the idea is bad, but because:

* Ideas are unstructured
* No clear execution roadmap
* Limited access to mentors
* Planning takes weeks and kills momentum

There is **no intelligent system** that behaves like a real startup team.

---

## 💡 Solution – GenStart AI

GenStart AI is a **multi-agent AI system** where each agent represents a real startup role.

A single idea input automatically generates:

* Business strategy
* Product design
* Technical architecture
* Marketing plan
* Investor-ready pitch

All outputs are **structured, human-readable, and exportable**.

---

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture

GenStart AI uses **role-based autonomous agents**, inspired by **Google ADK principles**.

| Agent               | Responsibility                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **CEO Agent**       | Problem, target users, revenue model |
| **Product Agent**   | Features, personas, MVP scope        |
| **Developer Agent** | Tech stack, APIs, architecture       |
| **Marketing Agent** | Branding, GTM strategy               |
| **Pitch Agent**     | 3-slide investor pitch               |

Agents collaborate sequentially, sharing context — just like a real startup team.
